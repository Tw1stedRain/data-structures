# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a BinaryTree class. Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called `preOrder`, `inOrder`, and `postOrder` which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Build three methods, each traverses the tree in a different order.

* `preOrder` traverses the tree root => left => right

* `inOrder` traverses the tree left => root => right

* `postOrder` traverses the tree left => right => root

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I built three similar methods, the only difference being where root is registered.
